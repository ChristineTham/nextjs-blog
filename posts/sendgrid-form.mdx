SendGrid is a popular SMTP mail delivery service to send emails without a
server. Integrating it with a Contact form in React and NextJS turned out
to be relatively easy.

First, you need to create an account, then an API key in SendGrid, with
restricted permission to just "Mail Send".

Then, follow the instructions
[here](https://docs-git-success-185-add-nextjs-sengrid-guide.zeit.now.sh/guides/deploying-nextjs-nodejs-and-sendgrid-with-zeit-now).

Essentially you create a simple API (in the `/pages/api` directory)
that uses the `@sendgrid/mail` package
to do the hard work (mine is called `send.ts`):

```ts
import { NowRequest, NowResponse } from '@vercel/node'
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail'

export default async (req: NowRequest, res: NowResponse) => {
  sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY)

  const { email, subject, message } = req.body

  const content = {
    to: 'learning.jamstack@hellotham.com',
    from: email,
    subject: subject,
    text: message,
    html: `<p>${message}</p>`
  }

  try {
    await sgMail.send(content)
    res.status(200).send('Message sent successfully.')
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).send('Message not sent.')
  }
}
```

And then make sure you define the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in your environment
so it can be picked up by the API above. There are various ways of doing this,
but I suggest you keep the API Key secret and not commit it to the
Github repository. Most static web app hosting providers have a way of
managing secrets.

As an example, this website is currenyly hosted on Vercel, and Vercel secrets
can be included in the environment according to
[this page](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables).

Now just create a form, and in the event handler when you press the Submit
button, invoke the API:

```js
const res = await fetch('/api/send', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(inputs)
})
```

Have a look at the source code of this website to see a complete
implementation.
