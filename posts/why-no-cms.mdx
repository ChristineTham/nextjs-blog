If you have looked at the source code repository for this site, you may notice
that this site stores blog posts as MDX files in the `posts` directory. Why did
I not use a Content Management System (CMS)?

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org) is still the most popular CMS in the world,
and is currently used in 60% of the world's websites. WordPress is a
traditional CMS that combines the content and presentation layers of a website.

Recently, the concept of a "headless" CMS has become popular. A headless CMS
focuses on storing and managing content, but lets you define the front end
for presenting the content yourself. Typically, you interact with a headless
CMS via an API, but some headless CMS are not truly "headless" but has a
frontend that you may optionally use. Indeed, WordPress could be used as a
headless CMS because it has a REST API that can be consumed.

There are many headless CMS options to choose from. It's a hot area of
innovation, and I've lost count as there seems to be a new one every few days
or so. For example, there is a
[list at the Jamstack site](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/)
which I know is incomplete.

Many of the newer ones are cloud based, which means they won't be free
forever, but some allow you to self host. There are even some, like
[NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io)
that allows you to continue to use flat files stored
in a repository (such as this site) to store content. Most are also open
source, but not all (especially not the commercial cloud based options)

So, given the choice, why did I choose not to build this website using a
headless CMS on day one.

Part of the reason is a desire not to be locked into a solution too early.
I want some time to explore the various options, and they all involve a
learning curve. Secondly, I wanted the site not to rely on any external
services just yet.

There is a simplicity and a sense of freedom from just storing everything
in a Github repository for the time being. My current requirements are
very simple and I don't immediately need all the advanced features like
role access, version control (although this is provided by Github anyway),
custom post types, image management etc.

I also like just typing in blog posts directly into Markdown from Visual
Studio Code, and I find I am a lot more productive in a familiar environment.

Eventually, I'll need the more advanced features (especially image and
gallery management), so stay tuned as things may change!
