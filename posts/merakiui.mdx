There are several sets of pre-designed [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
components that can be incorporated into web projects, regardless of what
technology stack is used.

Today I explore [MerakiUI](https://merakiui.com) which has been designed by
[Khatab Wedaa](https://github.com/khatabwedaa) and
[Mosab Ibrahim](https://miaababikir.me), two talented designers.

There are a range of components on offer in the following categories:

- Alerts
- Authentication
- Buttons
- Cards
- Forms
- Dropdowns
- Navbar
- Heros
- Sections
- Pagination
- Footers

All the components are well designed and can be used as starting points for
more elaborate components.

For an idea of how these components work in a real site, have a look at my
[Sample Meraki Page](/sample-meraki) which is this site's home page
reimplemented in MerakiUI.
