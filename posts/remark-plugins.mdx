Under the hood, MDX posts on this site are converted to HTML during build
time using the `next-mdx-remote` processor which uses
[remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and
[rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).

It's possible to enhance the processing by adding plugins, and previously
I had already enabled the `remark-math` and `remark-mdx-math-enhanced` plugins in my
article called [Rendering Math in Markdown](/posts/math).

I have now decided to explore what other
[remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins)
are available/

I have decided to install the following:

- [remark-slug](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-slug)
- [remark-autolink-headings](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-autolink-headings)
- [remark-toc](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc)
- [@silvenon/remark-smartypants](https://github.com/silvenon/remark-smartypants)
- [rehype-code-titles](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/rehype-code-titles)
- [rehype-highlight](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight)
