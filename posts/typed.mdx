I installed
[react-typed](https://github.com/ssbeefeater/react-typed)
which uses
[Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js)
as the underlying engine for animating typed text. I then made the component
available over MDX.

Here are some examples:

```tsx
<Typed strings={['Here you can find anything']} typeSpeed={40} />
```

<Typed strings={['Here you can find anything']} typeSpeed={40} />

```tsx
<Typed
  strings={['Search for products', 'Search for categories', 'Search for brands']}
  typeSpeed={40}
  backSpeed={50}
  attr="placeholder"
  loop
>
  <input type="text" />
</Typed>
```

<Typed
  strings={['Search for products', 'Search for categories', 'Search for brands']}
  typeSpeed={40}
  backSpeed={50}
  attr="placeholder"
  loop
>
  <input type="text" />
</Typed>
