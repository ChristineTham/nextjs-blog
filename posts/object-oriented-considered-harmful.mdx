title: Object Oriented Considered Harmful
description: My rant of the day. One of the reasons why I did not pursue
  software development as a career was that the computing industry in the
  1990s and 2000s was a nightmare created by an obsession with
  object-orientation.

In March 1968 in the _Communications of the ACM_ journal, the famous
computer scientist Edgar Dijkstra penned the infamous paper
[Go To Statement Considered Harmful](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf).

The paper was considered quite controversial and many people disagreed
with Dijkstra. Of course, in hindsight he was completely correct.

Dijkstra was also not a fan of object oriented computing. He was reputed to
say:

> Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could
> only have originated in California.

For a number of years I have been familiar with the observation that the
quality of code is a decreasing function of the density of object-oriented
paradigms that has been embraced by it's creators.

Indeed, I have never been in love with object orientation, and it was one of
the reasons I never really seriously pursued a career in software development.

When I went to university, the dominant language taught at universities were
Pascal and C. Some less enlightened institutions would continue to teach
FORTRAN or COBOL, but those lecturers were hopelessly out of touch and
good students knew to avoid their courses.

Pascal was simple and easy to program in, although a bit verbose and the
vanilla language did not have a lot of features. C was a lot nicer and
the standard C library was really powerful, but it was quite low level.

When I left university, I worked for a fintech doing synthetic options.
For some reason, the company thought it would be good to get into
object-oriented computing, and sent us to a C++ workshop taught by
Bjarne Stroustrup.

Before I attended the workshop, I was actually keen to learn more about C++
because I thought it would solve some of the obvious problems with C -
memory management being a primary example.

I left the workshop hating C++, and I had a good discussion with Bjarne.
He acknowledged a lot of my points, but felt that some of them were tied
to the C++ compiler being a transpiler rather than a true native compiler.
I agreed with some of his rebuttals.

Over the coming weeks, I grew more and more disenchanted with C++. I didn't
like the syntax, and object orientation made writing code a lot harder,
and more importantly, a lot less fun.

Object orientation encourages over abstraction, makes data less
portable, and discourages reuse.

To use a potentially less-than-useful analogy, let's compare writing code
to making a cup of coffee. In C, you will write a function that specifies
how to make a cup of coffee, and the ingredients may be in a data structure
(`struct`).

If you were to do the same in C++, you would need to describe an object
called coffee, potentially an object called cup, and all the ingredients
will also be objects, or at the very least properties of objects.

Then you need to decide whether making a coffee is a method on the coffee
object, or the cup object, or maybe you need to create a third object
that inherits from both of them. Pretty soon, you are worried about
constructors, polymorphism and whether you need to model the coffee machine as
an additional object.

You can't rest with just a coffee machine method. You are doing yourself
and the world a disservice unless you exhaustively model all the possible
methods and properties of the coffee, cup, and coffee machine objects. Then
you start realising you need to model the spoon, saucer and sugar objects.

Two weeks later, you have finally solved the problem of modelling a coffee
plantation, with full separation of concerns and views between the coffee
grower, seller and consumer.

And that in a nutshell is why I think object-orientation is just crazy.

Data Science has taught us that data should never be abstracted or encapsulated
in objects and need to be independent of the manipulating logic.

And any sufficiently complex object model is non reusable. Again, to take
the coffee analogy, you can't just make and drink the coffee. You have to
inherit the coffee object, the cup and everything all the way to the
coffee plantation.

And you can't mix and match between someone's coffee and another person's cup,
because they have made completely different design decisions on their
object modelling.

I realised this fairly early on, and then watched in dismay as the computing
world became obsessed with object-orientation and ever increasing
abstraction and complexity, with object frameworks competing with each other.

Java, Objective C were no better, and perhaps made it worse.

In a sense, modern programming has gone back to basics and I am glad. We
are no longer obsessed with over-abstracting everything. We are seeing a
return to using command line utilities and simple editors rather than bloated
IDEs, declarative/imperative UI frameworks rather than MVC, and functional
programming rather than object-oriented.

Coding has become fun again.
