According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress),
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org) runs on 60% of the world's websites.
I have used it to create websites in the last few years, and my company
offers WordPress hosting services for our clients based on a dedicated
[Plesk](https://plesk.com) server on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

I use a ton of plugins on WordPress, and have even created my own theme,
based on [Genesis Framework](https://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/).

I have also investigated [Ghost](https://ghost.org), an alternative to
WordPress based on a more modern codebase (it's written in
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) rather than [PHP](https://php.org)). Ghost
has built in SEO and membership/subscription features, and has a nice theming
system. I have written a few themes for Ghost. Ghost can also be used as a
headless CMS (actually, WordPress can as well through it's REST API).

Then there is [Hugo](https://gohugo.org), a really popular static site
generator. I really like Hugo, even though there is a steep learning curve.
I am currently trying to write a theme for Hugo.

## WordPress - so 1990s

My main issue with WordPress was that it is slow and clunky. It is PHP
server side rendering using an SQL backend. I have never bothered
learning PHP and don't intend to, so tinkering under the hood was always
going to be a bridge too far for me.

WordPress is also cumbersome. A highly functional site requires dozens of
plugins to manage things like image galleries, SEO, security, caching, backups,
plus UI enhancements. All these needed to be regularly updated, and can even
break with a major WordPress release.

WordPress is also in the middle of transitioning to a page builder system
(called Full Site Editing, based on Gutenberg), and
the front end of WordPress is now as much React as PHP. I can imagine in the
future WordPress may evolve into a static React frontend and a headless PHP
backend. Whilst WordPress is transitioning, I thought it may be worthwhile
to check out alternatives.

I attended the Jamstack conference and Nextjs conference in October 2020
and was fired up to learn Nextjs and write my first app. My main motivation
is to use this site as an excuse for learning and experimenting with NextJS.

## Disadvantages of NextJS

If you are reading this and considering following down the same path as me,
let's get through the cons first.

You are not writing content using a WYSIWYG
(What You See Is What You Get) editor, you are writing code. Javascript, HTML,
CSS ... you are pretty much building the website from scratch.

If this scares you, then you are probably not ready to create a blog in NextJS.

Of course, you don't have to start from nothing. There are starter kits,
UI components, even other people's blogs on Github that you can clone and fork.
You can also easily connect to a Headless CMS (Content Management System) and
get the benefits of WYSIMWYG (What You See Is Mostly What You Get) and have all
the hard bits of content management already handled for you.

However, NextJS is still a maturing web framework, so don't expect a rich
plugin and theme ecosystem compared to, say, Gatsby. Or Hugo. Or Ghost.
Or _cough cough_ ... WordPress.

## Advantages of NextJS

First of all, we get all the advantages of Jamstack. NextJS supports both
server side rendering and static prerendered content that can be served
entirely from a CDN (Content Distribution Network). A NextJS blog can be
deployed completely serverless for zero cost (provided you are not too
picky about domain names).

A static, serverless web site cannot be hacked, because there is no ~~spoon~~
_server_.

Thirdly, static web sites are blazingly fast, which is good for SEO (Search
Engine Optimisation). Since all the content is prerendered and delivered from
a CDN, page load speed is determined by content size and not complexity.

NextJS leverages React and the `npm` ecosystem. Compared to WordPress plugins
which usually cost money (per year), npm packages are open source and there is
a rich set of UI components, frameworks and functionality that is just one
`yarn` or `npm` install away.

NextJS is so _hot_ right now, mainly because it is relatively easy to learn,
is Typescript native, and offers a useful foundation without too mainly
complications. I have previously learnt Gatsby, and while it is undeniably
more powerful than NextJS and has a richer ecosystem, there are still lots of
things in Gatsby I don't understand or haven't mastered yet.

Finally, I _like_ building a website in code. I can do anything I want, have
complete design freedom, and I can creach rich dynamic experiences without
being restricted by a theme, or a plugin, or trying to figure out how
WordPress works.
