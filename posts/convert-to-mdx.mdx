title: Converting from Markdown to MDX in Nextjs
description: Many Jamstack blogs use Markdown as a format to create content.
  To enable advanced formatting, it is possible to an enhanced format known
  as MDX that combines Markdown and JSX elements (React components).

The [Learn Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) tutorial
on the [Nextjs site](https://nextjs.org) will result in a bare bones blog site
where posts are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) and
rendered using [remark](https://remark.js.org) as a processor.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to write content
with a minimum of fuss, but does limit the author to a restricted set of
formatting elements and styles. Although _remark_ does allow plugins to
enhance Markdown functionality, Markdown files will never be as rich as
full HTML.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is an enhanced version of Markdown that allows JSX
elements to be seamlessly embedded.

A good starting point for learning the various ways of using MDX in Nextjs
is on the NextJS blog:
[Markdown/MDX with Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown)
written by [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io).

One of the first things I did when I completed the _Learn NextJS_ tutorial
was to convert the site from Markdown to MDX.

I decided to use [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
approach to adding MDX to blog posts. this allows me to:

- easily override the style of markdown elements
- add front matter to the posts without complex JSX syntax
- insert a custom set of components that I can used in posts

The alternate approach, which I also experimented with, is to use
[@next/mdx](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx)
which enables me to have top level MDX pages. I implemented this as well,
but it requires an MDX provider in `_app` for styling.

There is also a
[next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced)
but I did not try that as the `README` said:

> ⚠️ You probably should be using next-mdx-remote instead of this library.
> It is ~50% faster, more flexible with content storage, does not induce memory
> issues at scale, and fits much better with the way that data is intended to
> flow through next.js.

As a test of MDX, here is a simple React component embedded in this post!

<TestComponent name="MDX" />
