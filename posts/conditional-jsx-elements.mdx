Ever since I started learning React and Typescript, I've been stumped whenever
I had to generate JSX variations based on a boolean condition (which could be a state, or a prop, or any sort of logical condition).

Here are some examples that I scratched my head over:

- add (or delete) a JSX element based on a condition
- add (or delete) a class in a JSX element based on a condition
- add (or delete) an attribute in a JSX element based on a condition

Everytime I find a solution to one of the above challenges, I forget a few
weeks later and then I have to waste time rediscovering a solution.

So I decided to finally document my solutions in a post so I can refer to it
next time I forget. All my examples are in `Typescript` but will be very
similar in `Javascript` (just omit the type declarations in the function component).

## Add/Delete a JSX element based on a condition

The Javascript ternary operator `?:` can be used inside the `{}` to
conditionally output different JSX Elements based on a condition:

```ts
const Component: React.FC<{condition: boolean}> = ({condition}) = > (
  <>
    {condition ?
      <JSXIfTrue/>
    :
      <JSXIfFalse/>
    }
  </>
)
```

If you wanted to only generate a JSX Element only if a condition is true or
false, and nothing for the opposite state, then you can use the Javascript
logical operators

```ts
const Component: React.FC<{condition: boolean}> = ({condition}) = > (
  <>
    {condition && <JSXIfTrue/>}
    {condition || <JSXIfFalse/>}
  </>
)
```

## Add/Delete a class in a JSX element based on a condition

This can be done using a Javascript string literal in conjunction with our friends
the ternary and logical operators.

```ts
const Component: React.FC<{condition: boolean}> = ({condition}) = > (
  <>
    <Child1 className={`button ${condition ? "btn-true" : "btn-false"}`}/>
    <Child2 className={`button ${condition && "btn-true"}`}/>
    <Child3 className={`button ${condition || "btn-false"}`}/>
  </>
)
```

If the `condition` is true the following JSX is generated:

```ts
<Child1 className="button btn-true"/>
<Child2 className="button btn-true"/>
<Child2 className="button"/>
```

And if false:

```ts
<Child1 className="button btn-false"/>
<Child2 className="button"/>
<Child3 className="button btn-false"/>
```

## Add/Delete an attribute in a JSX element based on a condition

This turned out to be the hardest challenge and relies on the Javascript
object destructuring operator, and a bit of inside knowledge that attributes in JSX
Elements are internally manipulated as Javascript objects.

If you didn't understand the above statement, don't worry, neither did I until
recently. You can just use the following as a recipe.

```ts
const Component: React.FC<{condition: boolean}> = ({condition}) = > (
  <>
    <Child1 {...(condition ?
      {trueattribute: "value"}
    :
      {falseattribute: "value"}
    )}/>
    <Child2 {...(condition && {trueattribute: "value"})}/>
    <Child3 {...(condition || {falseattribute: "value"})}/>
  </>
)
```

Believe it or not, if the `condition` is true the following JSX is generated:

```ts
<Child1 trueattribute="value"/>
<Child2 trueattribute="value"/>
<Child3/>
```

And if false:

```ts
<Child1 falseattribute="value"/>
<Child2/>
<Child3 falseattribute="value"/>
```

You can of course add additional attributes formatted as JSON object properties:

```ts
const Component: React.FC<{condition: boolean}> = ({condition}) = > (
  <>
    <ChildComponent {...(condition && {
      attribute1: "value",
      attribute2: "1"
    })}/>
  </>
)
```

This will generate (if condition is true):

```ts
<ChildComponent attribute1="value" attribute2="1" />
```

Amazing, isn't it?

## One last thing ... Conditionally include optional prop as attribute value

If you have an optional prop and it needs to be included as an attribute value in a JSX Element
(but only if it's defined by the caller), you can simply do this:

```ts
const Component: React.FC<{optionalProp?: string}> = ({optionalProp}) = > (
  <>
    <ChildComponent attribute={optionalProp}/>
  </>
)
```

Wait, what about checking whether `optionalProp` contains a value or not? Well,
it turns out React is pretty smart: if the caller didn't specify a value for
`optionalProp`, React omits the attribute and just generates `<ChildComponent/>`.

In the case of optional boolean props, you can just pass them to a child
component as easily as this (and the prop will not be included in the child
if false or undefined):

```ts
const Component: React.FC<{optionalBool?: boolean}> = ({optionalBool}) = > (
  <>
    <ChildComponent optionalBool={optionalBool}/>
  </>
)
```

Hopefully that will save you (and me) some redundant value checking in the
future!
