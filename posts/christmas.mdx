title: Merry Christmas and the site has reached maturity!
description: I started evolving this site from a vanilla NextJS tutorial
  and bare bones blog project into what you see today over a period of two
  months. It's been an amazing journey, and I am proud that the site has
  grown so much.

Today I am finally proud to declare the site has evolved to a point where it
is feature stable, as all the things I wanted to implement has been achieved.

You can see the list of changes as ~~strikeout text~~ in the
[Roadmap](/posts/roadmap) post.

Of course, this does not mean I will no longer update the site, but it may
be less frequent as I want to now focus on my design system. I haven't decided
whether I will create a separate site for the design system, but it's likely
I'll start by posting updates on my progress on this site.

I hope all of you have a wonderful Christmas and New Year and please continue
following my adventures in 2021!
