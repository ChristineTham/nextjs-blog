You tested and committed your latest changes, created a pull request on the
master branch and then approved it. You are pretty sure it's now deployed
into production. Or is it?

You browse pages on the production URL, but nothing has really changed. How
can you be absolutely sure the website contains your latest changes?
Hopefully, your static web hosting provider gives you that information (Vercel
does) but maybe you really really want to be sure.

One technique is to include website deployment information (such as the
last successful commit message) into a web page on your website, perhaps
the [About](/about) page or a hidden secret page that only you know about.

Vercel defines [System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables#system-environment-variables)
that you can query (provided you expose them in your project) to find out
various information relating to your current deployment, including
`VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` and `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE`. You also query
`VERCEL_ENV` to find out if you are currently on the production or
staging site.

You can also query the Nodejs `process` object to find out which version
of Node was used to build the site, and the underlying platform.

The only trick is, these environment variables and deployment information
are only available during the build phase. It's not available when a user
browses the static content that has been deployed, so the trick is to
get this information in `GetStaticProps` and pass them as props to your
page component

```ts
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => (
  props: {
    arch: process.arch,
    platform: process.platform,
    version: process.version,
    commit: process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE
  }
)

```

Then, in your page, you can display the information any way you want, for
example in a list (I used Javascript rather than Typescript in this
example for simplicity)

```js
const WebsiteInfo = ({ arch, platform, version, commit }) => (
  <ul>
    <li>{arch}</li>
    <li>{platform}</li>
    <li>{version}</li>
    <li>{commit}</li>
  </ul>
)
```

For a working example of this technique, please view the source for this
site's [About](/about) page.
