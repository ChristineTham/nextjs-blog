title: Implementing blog post pagination
description: Although this site does not have many posts, I have decided to
  try out pagination of posts on the home page. At most 6 posts are displayed
  but you can click on pages to see other posts.

Many sites with many posts implement a pagination system so that the page
that lists blog posts only show a fixed number, but you can click on a page
number or use next/previous page buttons to view other pages. This improves
performance so that the site only needs to fetch a subset of pages at any
given time.

This site is so small it's easy enough to show all posts on the same page,
but I thought I'll implement a pagination system on the home page just for
fun.

This turned out to be really easy to do using a package called
[react-paginate](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate).

To make pagination work, the component that displays the blog post cards
must be altered to only display a fixed number starting from an `offset`:

```tsx
{
  posts
    .slice(offset, offset + POSTS_PER_PAGE)
    .map(({ id, meta }) => <Article href={`/posts/${id}`} meta={meta} key={id} />)
}
```

The rest is handled by `react-paginate`

```tsx
const [offset, setOffset] = useState(0)

const handlePageClick = (data) => {
  const selected = data.selected
  const offset = Math.ceil(selected * POSTS_PER_PAGE)
  setOffset(offset)
}

;<ReactPaginate
  pageCount={Math.ceil(posts.length / POSTS_PER_PAGE)}
  marginPagesDisplayed={2}
  pageRangeDisplayed={3}
  onPageChange={handlePageClick}
/>
```
