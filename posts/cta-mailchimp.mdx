  you to subscribe to get notifications via email of future posts.

A standard technique on a website to measure user engagement is a Call to
Action (CTA) to encourage users to subscribe to a mailing list.

[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) is a popular email marketing platform
that also offers other services like transactional email and website hosting.

From the perspective of an app Mailchimp offers two APIs, a marketing API
and a transactional API (based on their acquisition of Mandrill).

Their [quick start guide](https://mailchimp.com/developer/guides/marketing-api-quick-start/)
gives the basics on how to start using their Marketing API. Essentially,
you need a Mailchimp account (there is a free plan) and a generated API key.

Mailchimp provides a convenient NPM package called
`@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing` that makes it super easy to use their services
to add a new contact (name and email address) to a mailing list (which
Mailchimp calls "Audience"). Unfortunately, the package is not
[Typescript friendly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64685959/mailchimp-mailchimp-marketing-types-d-ts-is-not-a-module-in-nodejs)
therefore requires a custom Typescript module declaration file.

This is the code to check that everything works and the Mailchimp API service
can be accessed:

```tsx
mailchimp.setConfig({
  apiKey: process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_KEY,
  server: process.env.MAILCHIMP_SERVER_PREFIX
})
const mailchimpResponse = await mailchimp.ping.get()
```

The above code can be included in an `async` function (such as
`GetStaticProps()` which is executed at build time) or in a serverless API
function defined in the `pages/api` directory.

This is the code to add a new contact to the mailing list:

```tsx
import { NowRequest, NowResponse } from '@vercel/node'
import mailchimp from '@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing'

export default async (req: NowRequest, res: NowResponse) => {
  const { firstname, lastname, email } = req.body

  if (!email) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email is required' })
  }

  try {
    mailchimp.setConfig({
      apiKey: process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_KEY,
      server: process.env.MAILCHIMP_SERVER_PREFIX
    })

    const response = await mailchimp.lists.addListMember(process.env.MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID, {
      email_address: email,
      status: 'subscribed',
      merge_fields: {
        FNAME: firstname,
        LNAME: lastname
      }
    })

    return res.status(201).send('You have been subscribed: ' + response.id)
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(400).send('An error has occurred.')
  }
}
```
