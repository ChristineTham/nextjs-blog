The term _Front Matter_ was originally coined to describe a fixed block
(in [YAML](https://yaml.org)) prepended in front of a Markdown document.

The Front Matter block contains a number of variables which can be used as
metadata to describe the post. The metadata is extracted when processing the
Markdown file.

I am currently using the following front matter variables to describe my blog
posts. Here is a sample template:

```yml

date: '2020-01-01'

title: Template Post

```

You may notice I am not currently doing anything with the `type` or `tags`
variables, but I may in the future.

The variables are strongly influenced by the
[Hugo Front Matter definitions](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/)

date
: the datetime assigned to this page

type
: the type of the content

draft
: if true, the content will not be rendered

title
: the title for the content

description
: the description for the content, used as a blog summary or blurb

author
: the author of the post

featured_image
: image used in the blog hero and blog card

tags
: an array of tags pertaining to the blog post

categories
: categories this post belong in
