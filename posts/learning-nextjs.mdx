Like many others, I started learning [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) by following
[Learn NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
which takes a beginner like me on a step by step journey building a simple
blog site from scratch. In fact, this website started it's origins using the
code from this tutorial!

However, I felt I still did not really understand NextJS after completing
the tutorial. I was going through the motions of copy and paste to build out
the site without really understanding the contents.

Much more recently, I watched [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io)'s excellent
[Mastering Nextjs](https://masteringnextjs.com) course.
I found this very helpful in terms of learning about different packages
I can use as part of building a Nextjs app.

I strongly recommend browsing the
[examples on the NextJS repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples)
and trying anything that is of interest. This is how I finally understood
NextJS and how this site started from those experiments.

After that, I recommend looking at various starter kits (also known as
_boilerplates_). Here are some that I have learnt from:

[Notus Nextjs](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/notus-nextjs)
: A free Tailwind UI and Admin Dashboard starter kit by the well known
UI kit seller, an evolution from their previous effort
[Tailwind Starter Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation).

[devii](https://devii.dev/)
: Colin McConnell's starter kit for creating a NextJS blog, also used as his
blog site. I strongly considered using this as a code base, but ultimately
decided to use the end point of _Learn NextJS_ because I found the code
easier to understand.

[Nextjs Blog Boilerplate](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Blog-Boilerplate.git)
: Nextjs Blog Boilerplate is starter code written by
[Creative Design Gurus](https://creativedesignsguru.com/).
Made with Nextjs, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS.

[Next.js with Theme UI Starter Kit](https://www.nextjs-starter.io/)
: A fairly opinionated and feature-full kit by Manny Becerra

[KNESTS Stack](https://github.com/tudorconstantin/knests/)
: A full-stack boilerplate suitable for hackathons etc. created by Tudor
Constantin. This includes a NodeJS backend on Docker, GraphQL and PostgreSQL.

[next-boilerplate](https://pankod.github.io/next-boilerplate/)
: Another boilerplate with a host of features, including a CLI tool for
creating new components.

[Nextron](https://npm.im/nextron)
: A package for creating NextJS desktop apps using Electron.

[nextjs-redux-starter](https://nextjs-redux-starter.now.sh/)
: Next.js + Redux + styled-components + Express for building an SPA.

[Next Right Now](https://unlyed.github.io/next-right-now/)
: Flexible production-grade boilerplate with Next.js 10, Vercel and TypeScript.
Includes multiple opt-in presets.

The main advantage of browsing starter kits is to get a sampling of how
different people structure a blog app, what tools and packages they use,
and how to implement features. However, I don't recommend actually using
a starter kit by cloning the repository. I feel whilst these kits are
useful, they sould serve as inspiration rather than an actual code base.

In my not so humble opinion, even minimalist starter kits are too opinionated
for me, and I often find I am fighting someone else's design and structure
and I may have to remove features I don't need or refactor code. At the end
of the day, every line of code that I write is a line I understand completely.

The other cautionary note I might add is be careful when browsing starter kits
because some of them are old code that haven't been updated recently. NextJS
evolves rapidly so an older starter kit may no longer be based on best
practices.
