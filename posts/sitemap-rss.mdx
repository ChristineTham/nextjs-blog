  rely on scripts or loaders.

According to [Sitemaps.org]():

> **Sitemaps** are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages
> on their sites that are available for crawling. In its simplest form, a
> Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs for a site along with additional
> metadata about each URL (when it was last updated, how often it usually
> changes, and how important it is, relative to other URLs in the site) so
> that search engines can more intelligently crawl the site.

> Web crawlers usually discover pages from links within the site and from
> other sites. Sitemaps supplement this data to allow crawlers that support
> Sitemaps to pick up all URLs in the Sitemap and learn about those URLs using
> the associated metadata. Using the Sitemap protocol does not guarantee that
> web pages are included in search engines, but provides hints for web crawlers
> to do a better job of crawling your site.

RSS, on the other hand, is a way for website authors to publish notifications
of new content on their website.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS):

> **RSS** (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that
> allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized,
> computer-readable format. These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep
> track of many different websites in a single news aggregator. The news
> aggregator will automatically check the RSS feed for new content, allowing
> the list to be automatically passed from website to website or from website
> to user. This passing of content is called web syndication. Websites usually
> use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as blog
> entries, news headlines, or episodes of audio and video series. RSS is also
> used to distribute podcasts. An RSS document (called "feed", "web feed",
> or "channel") includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like
> publishing date and author's name.

For this site, I have decided to use functions called from `getStaticProps()`
in `index.tsx` so they are
created during build without any changes in the Nextjs configuration or
requiring any additional plugins or loaders.

To generate the sitemap, I used a simple function that enumerates the files in
the `pages` and `posts` directories:

```tsx
function addPage(page) {
  const path = page
    .replace('pages', '')
    .replace('.tsx', '')
    .replace('.mdx', '')
    .replace('posts', '/posts')
  const route = path === '/index' ? '' : path

  return `  <url>
    <loc>${`${site.url}${route}`}</loc>
    <changefreq>hourly</changefreq>
  </url>`
}

export async function generateSitemap() {
  // Ignore Next.js specific files (e.g., _app.js) and API routes.
  const pages = await globby([
    'pages/**/*{.tsx,.mdx}',
    '!pages/_*.tsx',
    '!pages/posts/[id].tsx',
    '!pages/api'
  ])
  const posts = await globby(['posts/**/*.mdx'])
  const sitemap = `<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
${pages.map(addPage).join('\n')}
${posts.map(addPage).join('\n')}
</urlset>`

  fs.writeFileSync('public/sitemap.xml', sitemap)
}
```

And for the RSS feed, a function that uses the array of post metadata
generated and the npm package `rss`:

```tsx
export async function generateRSS(allPostData: PostMeta[]) {
  const feed = new RSS({
    title: site.title,
    description: site.description,
    site_url: site.url,
    feed_url: site.sitemap
  })

  function itemRSS(post: PostMeta) {
    feed.item({
      title: post.meta.title,
      description: post.meta.description,
      url: `${site.url}/${post.id}`,
      categories: post.meta.categories,
      date: post.meta.date,
      author: post.meta.author,
      enclosure: {
        url: `${site.url}${post.meta.featured_image.replace('.svg', '.png')}`,
        file: 'public' + post.meta.featured_image.replace('.svg', '.png')
      }
    })
  }

  allPostData.map(itemRSS)

  const rss = feed.xml({ indent: true })
  fs.writeFileSync('public/feed.xml', rss)
}
```
