Ever wanted to include a math formula in your blog posts? I studied Pure
Mathematics as a major in my BSc degree so I like to use math symbols and notation
in some of my posts.

For this site, I enabled the use of math blocks via
[remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/remark-math)
and
[Remark MDX math enhanced](https://github.com/goodproblems/remark-mdx-math-enhanced)
plugins.

The plugins use the underlying
[KaTeX](https://katex.org)
library for math typesetting, which is fast and reliable and created by the
Khan Academy.

For any post that needs to include math content, the following
code needs to be inserted into the markdown document
(or insert into the `_amp` component, at the cost
of slowing down the performance for all pages):

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.0/dist/katex.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-Xi8rHCmBmhbuyyhbI88391ZKP2dmfnOl4rT9ZfRI7mLTdk1wblIUnrIq35nqwEvC"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
/>
```

Here is an example of both inline and block math content generated using
the following text in the markdown document:

```markdown
Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$
```

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

Additional examples, taken from the KaTeX website:

$$
\displaystyle \frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }
$$

$$
\displaystyle \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

$$
\displaystyle {1 +  \frac{q^2}{(1-q)}+\frac{q^6}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}+\cdots }= \prod_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1-q^{5j+2})(1-q^{5j+3})}, \quad\quad \text{for }\lvert q\rvert<1.
$$
