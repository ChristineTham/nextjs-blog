According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization):

> Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and
> quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.

Successful SEO means a web page will be more likely to appear higher on a
search engine results page. This is a complex and dynamic process, since
search engines do not fully disclose their algorithms and change them from
time to time.

According to [Webopedia](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SEO.html),
many factors can potentially be involved in the
search ranking of a particular web page:

- _Keyword density_, or the frequency with which a targeted word or phrase
  appears in the content of the page. (SEO is improved by keywords that are
  used appropriately.)
- _Bounce rate_, or how often a user visits the page and exits without visiting
  any other pages. (High bounce rate can detract from SEO.)
- _Metadata_, or the information that summarizes the content on the page.
- _Social media traffic_, which indirectly signals that a page contains content
  that's in high demand. (High traffic from social media is beneficial to SEO,
  but lack of social media traffic doesn't necessarily have a negative impact.)
- _Links_, including backlinks, outbound links, and internal links, which
  indicate credibility and relevance to and from other content on the internet.
  (Google looks favorably on sites that strategically direct traffic to other
  sources.)
- _EAT_ (Google's acronym for expertise, authority, and trustworthiness), which
  signifies that a page has a reputable author.
- _Security_, as signified by a site's SSL certificate, which search engines
  use to verify that site has a secure connection and it's safe to share
  personal information.
- _Load speed_, or the time it takes a web page to completely load.
  (Slow load speed can detract from SEO.)
- _Mobile responsiveness_, or how a web page adjusts to different screen sizes.
- _User experience_, or the features that could improve (or diminish) a user's
  interaction with the content on a page.

This article focuses on a specific technique for improving SEO, which is to
incorporate structured metadata on the contents of each page to social
media platforms and search engines using a package called `next-seo`.

Next SEO is a plug in that makes managing your SEO easier in Next.js projects.
It allows you to easily add SEO attributes (metadata) into specific pages, or
have default attributes on every page via the `_app` component.

Next SEO supports the [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me) which was created
by Facebook but also supported by Twitter and Linkedin. In addition, Next SEO
supports [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started)
and [Schema](https://schema.org) JSON-LD data which are used by
Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex.

My default next-seo configuration is in `next-seo-config.js` and loaded
on every page using the `DefaultSeo` component in `_App.tsx`

```jsx
const SEO = {
  openGraph: {
    type: 'website',
    locale: 'en_AU',
    site_name: 'Learning Jamstack',
    images: [
      {
        url: 'https://learning-jamstack.hellotham.com/images/screenshot.png',
        alt: 'Screenshot'
      }
    ]
  },
  twitter: {
    handle: '@chris1tham',
    site: 'Chris1Tham',
    cardType: 'summary_large_image'
  }
}

export default SEO
```

On the index page, I add additional JSON-LD tags appropriate for a blog site
as well as the site title and description

```tsx
<NextSeo
  title={site.title}
  description={site.description}
  openGraph={{
    title: site.title,
    description: site.description
  }}
/>
<BlogJsonLd
  url={site.url}
  title={site.title}
  images={[site.url + '/images/screenshot.png']}
  datePublished="2020-12-01"
  dateModified={buildDate}
  authorName={site.author}
  description={site.description}
/>
```

There are also user profile specific Open Graph and JSON-LD tags:

```tsx
<NextSeo
  title={title}
  description={description}
  openGraph={{
    title: title,
    description: description,
    type: 'profile',
    profile: {
      firstName: 'Chris',
      lastName: 'Tham',
      username: 'chris1tham',
      gender: 'female'
    },
    images: [
      {
        url: site.url + '/images/hellokitty.jpg',
        alt: title
      }
    ]
  }}
/>
<SocialProfileJsonLd
  type="Person"
  name="Chris Tham"
  url={site.url}
  sameAs={[site.facebook, site.instagram, site.linkedin, site.twitter]}
/>
```

Finally, for each blog post/article, we use specific article tags:

```tsx
      <NextSeo
        title={meta.title}
        description={meta.description}
        openGraph={{
          title: meta.title,
          description: meta.description,
          type: 'article',
          article: {
            publishedTime: meta.date,
            section: meta.categories[0],
            authors: [meta.author],
            tags: meta.tags
          },
          images: [
            {
              url: site.url + meta.featured_image.replace('.svg', '.png'),
              alt: meta.title
            }
          ]
        }}
      />
      <ArticleJsonLd
        url={url}
        title={meta.title}
        images={[site.url + meta.featured_image.replace('.svg', '.png')]}
        datePublished={meta.date}
        dateModified={meta.date}
        authorName={[meta.author]}
        publisherName={meta.author}
        publisherLogo={site.url + '/android-chrome-512x512.png'}
        description={meta.description}
      />
```

There are various tools to check the validity of the SEO metadata
