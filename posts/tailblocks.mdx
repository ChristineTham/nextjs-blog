There are several sets of pre-designed [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
components that can be incorporated into web projects, regardless of what
technology stack is used.

Today I explore [tailblocks](https://mertjf.github.io/tailblocks/) which has
been designed by Mert Cukuren (@knyttneve), a UI developer.

There are over 15 categories of components on offer:

- Blog
- Contact
- Content
- CTA
- ECommerce
- Feature
- Footer
- Gallery
- Header
- Hero
- Pricing
- Statistic
- Step
- Team
- Testimonial

The components appear to be primarily designed for a marketing site and
comparable to the Marketing UI components in [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com).

I like that on the website you can choose dark/light mode and preferred colour
variant and the website will automatically preview the component and allow
the code to be copied.

All the components are well designed (although I made some minor changes
to fix some responsive issues, but that was because I deviated a bit from
the vanilla component design).

For an idea of how these components work in a real site, browse this site!
Most of the components on the home page (apart from the footer which uses Notus)
are based on tailblocks components!
