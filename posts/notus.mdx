There are several sets of pre-designed [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
components that can be incorporated into web projects, regardless of what
technology stack is used.

Today I explore [Notus NextJS](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/notus-nextjs)
which has been designed by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/).

Creative Tim started by making Bootstrap design themes but have since expanded
to Material UI and have now released a UI Kit based on TailwindCSS which
they call Notus. Notus is mostly based on their earlier effort called
[Tailwind Starter Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation)
which is still available. Notus adds on top of the Tailwind Starter Kit (which
was HTML only) by adding Javascript and support for various web frameworks
including vanilla React, vanilla Javascript, Vue, Angular, NextJS and Svelte.

The version of Notus I am exploring is the NextJS version called Notus NextJS.

I am struck by how pretty the demo pages are. Creative Tim has designed various
pages including a landing page, profile page plus an Admin Layout including
Dashboard, Settings, Tables and Map. In addition, Login and Register pages
are provided, so there is enough design content to start building a web app.

The components themselves are similar to Bootstrap components so should aid
someone transitioning from Bootstrap to TailwindCSS:

- Alerts
- Badge
- Buttons
- Dropdowns
- Images
- Inputs
- Menus
- Modals
- Navbar
- Pagination
- Popovers
- Progressbars
- Tabs
- Tooltips

In addition, there are support for ChartJS, PopperJS and React Google Maps
plugins.

There are no higher level block components such as Hero, Pricing and CTA
sections so this is an Admin UI rather than Marketing or blog kit.

Although Creative Tim claims Notus does not 'does not change or add any CSS'
to TailwindCSS, there's a fairly heavy config file:

```json
module.exports = {
  future: {
    removeDeprecatedGapUtilities: true,
    purgeLayersByDefault: true,
  },
  purge: {
    enabled: true,
    content: ["./**/*.html", "./*.html", "./**/*.js", "./*.js"],
    options: {
      whitelist: [],
    },
  },
  theme: {
    extend: {
      minHeight: {
        "screen-75": "75vh",
      },
      fontSize: {
        "55": "55rem",
      },
      opacity: {
        "80": ".8",
      },
      zIndex: {
        "2": 2,
        "3": 3,
      },
      inset: {
        "-100": "-100%",
        "-225-px": "-225px",
        "-160-px": "-160px",
        "-150-px": "-150px",
        "-94-px": "-94px",
        "-50-px": "-50px",
        "-29-px": "-29px",
        "-20-px": "-20px",
        "25-px": "25px",
        "40-px": "40px",
        "95-px": "95px",
        "145-px": "145px",
        "195-px": "195px",
        "210-px": "210px",
        "260-px": "260px",
      },
      height: {
        "95-px": "95px",
        "70-px": "70px",
        "350-px": "350px",
        "500-px": "500px",
        "600-px": "600px",
      },
      maxHeight: {
        "860-px": "860px",
      },
      maxWidth: {
        "100-px": "100px",
        "120-px": "120px",
        "150-px": "150px",
        "180-px": "180px",
        "200-px": "200px",
        "210-px": "210px",
        "580-px": "580px",
      },
      minWidth: {
        "140-px": "140px",
        "48": "12rem",
      },
      backgroundSize: {
        full: "100$",
      },
    },
  },
  variants: [
    "responsive",
    "group-hover",
    "focus-within",
    "first",
    "last",
    "odd",
    "even",
    "hover",
    "focus",
    "active",
    "visited",
    "disabled",
  ],
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/custom-forms")],
};
```

I was surprised by the amount of custom sizes and spacing, and the number of
variants required, and I would have preferred a more vanilla approach
sticking to the constraints already provided by Tailwind. I suspect pixel
based sizes are required by the demo page layouts.

I created a version of this site's homepage based on the sample homepage in
the Notus NextJS source code, but I removed all the custom sizes and replaced
with standard Tailwind sizes, so I ended up not having to use the config file.

I also replaced the use of Font Awesome icons with HeroIcons.

Please have a look at my
[Sample Notus Page](/sample-notus) which is this site's home page
reimplemented in Notus. I really like the non-"blocky" design but it may
be a bit too hard to maintain or change over time.
