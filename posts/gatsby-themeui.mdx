I've decided to refresh my knowledge of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) by
creating a one page portfolio site written in Gatsby using
[Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com) based on the [Cara](https://cara.lekoarts.de/)
theme by [LekoArts](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/). The source code for this
website is available on
[Github](https://github.com/ChristineTham/christham-portfolio) and it is
hosted on [Gastby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/).

This website showcases some techniques that are new to me:
* animation using `react-spring`
* absolute positioning of elements using `theme-ui` `sx` props
* Using a gastby theme
* Embedding MDX in a page
* Light and Dark theme styles
