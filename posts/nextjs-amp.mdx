According to the [AMP website](https://amp.dev):

> AMP is an open-source HTML framework that provides a straightforward way to
> create web pages that are fast, smooth-loading and prioritize the
> user-experience above all else.

AMP pages are cached by the
[Google AMP Cache](https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/)
which are used by Google Products (including search) to speed up URL requests.
It's basically a proprietary CDN tied to a search engine.

Although I am not a fan of Google and don't use their services, I discovered
[AMP is built into Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/amp-support/introduction),
so I gave it a go.

The basic instructions are on the
[Nextjs AMP documentation page](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/amp).

Here is a [Sample Amp Page](/sample-amp-page) on this site.
